    <p><strong>Mariama Sillah</strong> a graduate student that lived in china for the past <strong>8years</strong>as a foreign student studying the language,culture and some other courses.</p>

    <p>The past years, I had the opportunity to travel to China for business. I joined my dad and some of his Chinese partners on a group to work on project that was organized by his Chinese friends. It is no exaggeration to say that this was a trip of a
      <strong>lifetime</strong>. Few years in the planning, the project covered several aspects through three cities, starting in <strong>Guangzhou</strong> and ending in <strong>Hong Kong</strong>.
      <p>I ended up in school studying <strong>Chinese language and culture</strong> which exposed and developed my personality to a total different person. I enjoyed my stay in china as a foreign student than accompanied in business.i traveled by bus, bullet
        train, boat,and airplane, and stayed in some of the finest hotels the country has to offer. I saw some truly amazing sites, and I learned quite a bit about Chinese history and culture from my Chinese friends in the past years.</p>
      <p>I took notes along the way so I could dwell on what I saw and experienced. Overall, it was an incredible experience even if it was also exhausting.</p>

      <p>China's enormous population, and in addition, the lopsided ratio between men and women of marrying age, are ongoing problems. According to current estimates, the ratio of men to women is<strong> 1.057 </strong>to 1â€”which means there could be around
        28 million men who may not be able to find a wife.</p>

      <p>The <strong>one-child policy</strong>, which was introduced in 1979 and phased out in 2015, has already had (and will continue to have) long-term implications for China.</p>

      One fact that I learned from our guide is that China's ethnic minorities were exempt from the <strong>one-child policy</strong>. The country is not as monolithic as one might think. The majority of Chinese people are Han, an ethnic group that accounts
      for 91% of the population. The remaining 9% is composed of 55 other ethnic groups. For example, the Zhuang number around 17 million.

      <p>Despite the fact that China has now phased out the one-child policy, I learned from our guide that some young people today are choosing to have only one child, rather than two. The main reason is economic. It is expensive to raise a child, and some
        parents are choosing to improve their economic status rather than have a second child.</p>

      <p>A rapidly aging population, coupled with a stubbornly low birth rate, will certainly affect the pension system and elder care. I don't want to debate the merits of the one-child policy, but in my opinion, it is always better to let people choose
        for themselves whenever possible. <strong>Collectively and individually</strong>, people will do what is best for their own situation. This is one of the tenets of democracy and free society.</p>
